//Zap: This is an automated workflow that connects two or more apps. 
//It consists of a Trigger and one or more Actions. When a specific event (Trigger) occurs in one app, 
//it initiates a series of actions in other apps.

// Trigger: A Trigger is an event that starts a Zap.
// For example, if you want a Zap to start when a new email arrives in Gmail, the email arrival is the Trigger. 
//Triggers are essentially the starting points of a Zap.

// Action: An Action is an event that happens as a result of the Trigger. 
//Itâ€™s what the Zap does after the Trigger event occurs. 
//For example, if the Trigger is a new email, the Action could be creating a new task in a project management tool like Trello.
